This is some small changes to the cmemcache client to make it compatible with
the changes that we (at Yelp) have made to the python client. Right now all
this adds is a new attribute on the Client object, recv_bytes, that is set to
the number of bytes that were received over the wire by a get request (maybe
some improved log handling will go in later, but it looks like that is much
better with the latest 0.94 release so maybe not).

The diff against the upstream cmemcache code is very small (just a couple of
lines) and the changes are probably safe.

More stuff in the TODO file.
