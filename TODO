Integrate libketama consistent hashing into the libmemcache code. I sort of
looked at this, it looks like the cmemcache Client object has an mc_ctxt
attribute when cast as a CmemcacheObject, and the mc_ctxt is of type (struct
memcache_ctxt *). In the libmemcace code the process of connecting to the right
server is a two-part process:
  hash = ctxt->mcHashKey(ctxt, mc, key, key_len);
  mcm_server_connect_next_avail(ctxt, mc, hash);

So what we need to do to integrate libketama is to change the mcHashKye
function to the hashing function used by libketama and to change the
mcm_server_connect_next_avail to use the mechanism provided by libketama.
Mostly the mcHashKey function just looks like it's followed by
mcm_server_connect_next_avail but it seems to be used in a couple of other
places too, so we need to be careful to update this correctly.
