Description
===========

Python extension for `libmemcache <http://people.freebsd.org/~seanc/libmemcache>`_, the C
API to `memcached <http://www.danga.com/memcached/>`_. cmemcache API is very similar to
`python-memcache <ftp://ftp.tummy.com/pub/python-memcached/>`_, except for some return
codes which follow libmemcache conventions.

cmemcache is about 2 times faster then python-memcache with short key names (8
characters), faster with larger key names.

Motivation
==========

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../gijsbert.org/vads.html

This extension was created after doing some timings on a simple session caching scheme
where I noticed that python-memcache was 'only' three times as fast as PostgreSQL. I
expected it to be faster than that, since PostgreSQL does a lot more than memcached. It
was suggested that it was perhaps python-memcache, which for instance gets the initial
part of the message from memcached byte for byte. After discovering libmemcache it seemed
pretty straight forward to create an extension on top of that.

cmemcache has 2 clients: StringClient and Client. StringClient is the extension that only
supports python strings for values. The api was copied from python-memcache, except that
it excepts strings only. Client is a module that implements caching of arbitrary python
objects using Pickle on top of the StringClient. This code is a copy/paste from
python-memcache. Most of the test code in `test.py <test.py>`_ is run on the cmemcache
Client and the python-memcache Client to make sure that they are interchangeable. Although
I have not tested this but it should be possible to mix cmemcache and python-memcache
clients in a running system as well, since they use the same constants for encoding object
types.

The speed difference would be less if the memcached protocol would be changed to precede
the reply header with its size. A client could then read the header size, read the full
header (in one read), parse header to get the data size, and read data (this is already
done in one read).

Dependencies
============

- `Python <http://www.python.org>`_
- `libmemcache <http://people.freebsd.org/~seanc/libmemcache>`_ (using version 1.4.0.rc2,
  not sure which is required)

Download
========

- `Download </downloads/cmemcache/>`_

To do
=====

- use mc_req_add_ref to avoid copy of key
- add performance test to test.py

Known Bugs
==========

cmemcache:

- Aborting libmemcache errors are not converted into python exceptions.

libmemcache:

- set_servers with the wrong port number causes a segfault (in libmemcache). See commented
  out testing code in test.py.

- mc_err_filter_add() broken. This results in warnings on add() and replace().

  This is fixed by applying the patch from the download section.

- libmemcache-1.4.0.rc2 is not compatible with memcached 1.2.1, this results in get_stats
  returning no stats.

- start memcached, create Client, kill memcached, start memcached, do a get() and python
  process exits, with messages like::

    [ERROR@1170236923.979369] mcm_buf_read():361: read(2) failed: Operation now in progress:
    server unexpectedly closed connection

  libmemcache does an exit on severe errors. It is possible to install an error handler
  that could change the severity to not exit and then the python extension could throw a
  python exception. However, I do not know if libmemcache will recover correctly.

  I do not have time at the moment to try and fix this.

Changes
=======

Versions:

0.94
  Added missing debuglog() implementation, copy/paste error from memcache.py. get() now
  returns None on all error cases. Reported by Simon Law.

  Fixed some memory leaks in get_multi().

  Fixed get_multi() return values for Client. All results would be returned as 
  strings, instead of the proper types. Reported and fixed by Alfred J Fazio.

  cmemcache.py uses debuglog() (memcache.py remnant) but debuglog() is not even defined,
  doh! Reported by Simon Law. His patch uses python module logging, but to avoid
  dependencies I added the same stderr logger as used in memcache.py. One can override
  the cmemcache.log variable to install another log function.

0.93
  Fixed memory leak caused by not Py_DECREF of key and val objects when calling
  PyDict_SetItem(). Reported and fixed by Alfred J Fazio.

  Allocated my own context and moved from 'mc_*' api to 'mcm_*' api to use. Install error
  handler to change the 'cont' state of the memcache_err_ctxt object to 'y' to try not to
  abort on fatal errors. This is an attempt to not crash python on fatal errors from
  libmemcache, but libmemcache needs considerable changes to make it work. I am not too
  sure about my libmemcache so I have not released them yet. Code is compatible with
  libmemcache-1.4.0 though.

0.92
  Changed return values for set, add, and replace to be the same as memcache.py, ie
  nonzero on success. Reported by Marek Majkowski.

0.91
  Remove ``@staticmethod`` from ``_convert`` method to make it python 2.3 compatible.

0.90
  Initial version.
